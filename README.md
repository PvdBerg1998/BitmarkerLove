# Bitmarker Decoder GUI
This tool is written to assist in decoding the bitmarkers on my nanowire deposition substrate.

For more information, please read the [documentation](https://github.com/PvdBerg1998/BitmarkerLove/blob/master/Doc/bitmarker_doc.pdf).

## Controls
- R = Reset to $(0, 0)$.
- 3 = Set 3x3 bitmarker mode.
- 4 = Set 4x4 bitmarker mode.
- Q or Esc = Quit.

## Releases

Prebuilt Windows packages available [here](https://github.com/PvdBerg1998/BitmarkerLove/releases).

Can also be ran on Android using [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.love2d.android&hl=en&gl=US), though the mode switching controls may be impractical without a keyboard. The default mode is 4x4.
